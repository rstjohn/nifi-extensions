<div>
    Track a Tumbling Window based on evaluating an Expression Language expression on each FlowFile and add that value to the processor's state.
    Each FlowFile will be emitted with the count of FlowFiles and total aggregate value of values processed in the current time window. It should be
    noted that the aggregated counts are reset after each Time Window elapses. This behaviour is slightly differently than the built-in NiFi processor
    named AttributeRollingWindow.
</div>
<h2 style="padding-bottom:0;margin-bottom: 0;">Basic Usage:</h2>
<div>
    Aggregate an expression language value within a time window, reporting the sum and count at the end of the window. One common use-case is to use
    this as a counter within a fixed time window. For example, compute and report the average latency. This would be implemented by
    simply using 1-minute time window to sum the extracted flowfile attribute that represents latency and then sending the metrics to an external service,
    like CloudWatch or DataDog.
</div>
<h2 style="padding-bottom:0;margin-bottom: 3px;">Relationships:</h2>
<div style="margin-bottom: 10px">
    <b>elapsed</b><br/>
    this relationship receives one flowfile when the time window tumbles. For example, if the time window is set to 1 minute, this relationship
    will receive a flowfile every minute. The contents of this flowfile will remoain unchanged, but the latest metrics attributes will be added to
    AttributeTumblingWindow.sum and AttributeTumblingWindow.count.
</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 10px">
    <b>non-elapsed</b><br/>
    this relationship receives every flowfile except the one when the time window tumbles. As such, if downstream processors require
    all events, both non-elapsed and elapsed relationships should be used.
</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 10px">
    <b>failure</b><br/>
    this relationship receives flowfile that could not be processed. The most common case is when the attribute being aggregated
    is not parsable to a real number.
