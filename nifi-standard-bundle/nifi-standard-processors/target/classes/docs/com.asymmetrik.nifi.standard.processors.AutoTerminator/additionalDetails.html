<h2 style="padding-bottom:0;margin-bottom: 0;">Description:</h2>
<div>
    This processor consumes every flowfile that it receives. It is intended to be used for during debugging. In production flows, where data loss is
    unacceptable, this processor should <b>not</b> be used.
</div>
<h2 style="padding-bottom:0;margin-bottom: 0;">Relationships:</h2>
<div>
    <b>nowhere</b><br/>
    this relationship never receives any data. It exists solely because NiFi does not behave properly when flows contain processors with no relationships.
    At the time of this writing, template backup and restore did not work properly for processor without at least one relationship.</ul>
